# Bootplate 
#### V 0.0.1

## Why? 

Was working with bootstrap and html5-boilerplate. Its not that tough to use these two togather. But to save some time, i tried to search for a already available boilerplate. But whatever came on first place, didn't quite the thing i was expecting. To me, that was kinda klingon stuff for wanna-be-nerd people. So thought about coming with a simple solution which is as simple as it need to be and will be easy-to-use for both wanna-be-nerd and already-nerd people. 

Nuff Said, lets get to work.
