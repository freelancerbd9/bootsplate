# Bootplate V 0.0.1


## Why? 

Was working with bootstrap and html5-boilerplate. Its not that tough to use these two togather. But to save some time, i tried to search for a already available boilerplate. But whatever came on first place, didn't quite the thing i was expecting. To me, that was kinda klingon stuff for wanna-be-nerd people. So thought about coming with a simple solution which is as simple as it need to be and will be easy-to-use for both wanna-be-nerd and already-nerd people. 

Nuff Said, lets get to work. 

## Getting Started 

As you already know its a combination of [html5-boilerlate](http://html5boilerplate.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). So there isn't much to talk about. Lets take a look under the hood.

* [Normalize] (https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) to keep stuff smooth everywhere. 
* `bootstrap.css` The core bootstrap Stylesheet.
* `bootstrap-theme.css` Bootstrap theme, comes with bootstrap 3.0.3.
